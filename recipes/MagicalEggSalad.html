      <p>Egg salad is a dish made primarily of chopped hard-boiled or scrambled eggs, mustard, and mayonnaise, often including other ingredients such as celery.

        It is made mixed with seasonings in the form of herbs, spices and other ingredients, bound with mayonnaise. It is similar to chicken salad, ham salad, macaroni salad, tuna salad, lobster salad, and crab salad.[1] A typical egg salad is made of chopped hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, minced celery and onion, salt, black pepper and paprika. A common use is as a filling for egg sandwiches. It is also often used as a topping for a green salad.[2</p>
