    <h1>Appke Cobbler</h1>
    <img src="cobbler.jpeg "style="width:40%; height:40%" alt="image of apple cobbler ready to eat">
    <p>It's made with fresh apples in a cinnamon sauce, with a delicious cake-like topping. We can't get enough of cobbler recipes at our house. We enjoy peach cobbler and blueberry cobbler all year round, but when apple season comes, it's either homemade apple crisp, apple cobbler, or fresh apple cake; on repeat!</p>
